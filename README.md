# TypeScript language support in Atom

[![CI](https://github.com/lunar-editor/language-typescript/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lunar-editor/language-typescript/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for TypeScript in Atom. The grammar is the [Microsoft TypeScript TextMate grammar](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage) and copied here on a semi-regular basis. Any issues relating to syntax highlighting are likely to be there.
